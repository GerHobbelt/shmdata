Switcher
========
Switcher for audio, video, data and network streams.

Switcher is the successor of Scenic's milhouse utility. It provides basic video signal routing, switching and mixing features. It was created at the Society for Arts and Technology (SAT) to give to artists a powerful tool for telepresence in contexts of live arts and new media installations.
