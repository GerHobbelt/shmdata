# GRAPHIC CHARTER 


## PRIMARY AND SECONDARY LOGOS

#### GRAPHIC GRID

Here is the graphic grid of the logo, with the proportions to be respected at each use of the logo. Whether it is to appear in an application, on a website, on a letterhead, on a poster or in a series of logos, the proportions must ALWAYS be respected.

#### PROTECTIVE SPACE

At all times, the logo must be surrounded by a clear area to be legible and communicate effectively. No text, lines, typographical elements, images, photographs or illustrations must occupy this space.
