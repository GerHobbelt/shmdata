Coding style
------------

We use Google C++ Style Guide, as described [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), with two exceptions:
* A function call’s arguments will either be all on the same line or will have one line each. 
* A function declaration’s or function definition’s parameters will either all be on the same line or will have one line each.

For python code, we use PEP8 style guide with maximum line length set to 120.
