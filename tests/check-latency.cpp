/**
 * This test measures the latency between a write and a read from a Shmdata.
 * This is done as follows: writer measures curent time, and writes the value into the shmdata.
 * When called back, the reader mesures its curent time and compute the latency with the
 * time value read from the shmdata.
 *
 * The test succeed if the duration between a write and a read is less than a millisecond.
 * The actual duration, however, is more likely being around few microseconds.
