CODING
======

Coding style
------------

We use Google C++ Style Guide, as decribed [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). In switcher, you may find not compliant code, but newly introduced code must follow this guide. Note that you may find configuration file for your editor [here](https://github.com/google/styleguide).
